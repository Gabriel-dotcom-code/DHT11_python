# DHT11_python
Integrating Python language to the arduino hardware through DHT11 and Ultrsonic sensor, allowing to plot live data.

In this project the objective is to read live data from the DHT humidity and temperature sensor and Ultrasonic sensor, assembled in the Arduino Uno hardware.
Ever since I started to learn some things about Arduino there was some sort of thought like: 'I need to figure out a way to communicate Python with this thing!', and after
some coding experience and hours of research I could make it. **Thanks everone who contributed to public forums and the community of python programmers. All I've 
accomplished it's because of these forums.**

This repository is just a step on what is possible to do, so my advice is: replicate and try something different yourself to get different insights.

Sometimes the decode() function won't start right away and I could't fix that, if anyone knows feel free to text me!
